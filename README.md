#### Okuda

Yes, that's named after the guy who designed LCARS. Who said we can't be pretentious?

Anyway, the goal of this project is to write a row-centric graphing library. Most tools,
(and, in particular, the Google Chart Tools) support many types of graphs but require
programmers to effectively write code for a spreadsheet application, generating column
headers and then tracking rows as lists.

For this project, I hoped to simply use native JavaScript objects ordered by property
name, to better handle cases in which data are missing or unknown. This, I feel, more
adequately provides a mapping onto the various abstractions programmers are used to when
writing software. This means that constructing objects is relatively straightforward:

```
var data = [
	{ x: 0.5, y: 12 },
	{ x: 0.2, y: 14 },
	// ...
];
```

For the same reason, I've tried to make the graph constructor very simple â€” just call `Okuda.graph` to render a graph on your `<canvas>` object. In this regard Okuda is very similar to Chart Tools in that making a graph, once data are imported, is relatively straightforward.
	
```
Okuda.graph({
	data: items,
	// sequential: true // uncomment if data should be connected with lines.
	dependent: [
		{
			field: "y",
			label: "Controls"
		}
	],
	independent: [
		{
			field: "x",
			label: "Measurement"
		},
	],
	canvas: document.getElementsByTagName('canvas')[0]
});
```

Please contact me if you are considering using this for something. As it stands, this is little more than a side-project and has quite a few rough spots.
